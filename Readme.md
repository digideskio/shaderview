#ShaderView

Mad scrawlings of thoughts and ideas. Work in progress. Unstable.

### OSC based Uniforms

Osc Server listening on port 9177: 

```
Messages / Arguments
* "/uniform" <UniformName> <FloatValue>
* "/smoothed-uniform" <UniformName> <FloatValue>
* "/shader" <StringValue>
```

The uniforms are updated and sent to running shader.

Ruby Example:
```ruby
require 'osc-ruby'
@client = OSC::Client.new('localhost', 9177)
@client.send(OSC::Message.new("/shader" , "/Users/josephwilk/shaders/wave.glsl"))
```

Clojure example:
```clojure
(use 'overtone.osc)
(def client (osc-client "localhost" 9177))

(osc-send client "/uniform" "iExample" (float 100.0))
(osc-send client "/shader" "/usr/josephwilk/repl_electric.glsl")
```
